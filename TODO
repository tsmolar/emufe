It's now working in SDL2!  But there are a number of bugs noticed
 x1. Keyboard navigation doesn't work (key mapping issue?)
  2. Mouse Navigate isn't hitting the exact right spot
  3. menu hilighter doesn't seem to be working
  4. You can see too many screen updates, is RendererPresent getting
     called too frequently?  May need to use the autoupdate flag to
     reduce.
  5. No mouse wheel?
  6. It fails with 16-bit depth, but not 32.  SDL1 always used 16.  
     I don't necessarily need 16 to work, but just want to understand it
     better.  (reports invalid pixel format)
     
New SDL1 issues:
  SDL1 and SDL2 are not defined for emufe!  We can either define them
  or call s2a_flip() for both versions

Code Issues:

* masked blit currently has no SDL2 support
* remove more warnings
* Fix all the UpdateRects
