EMUFE 3.1.4 README 7-12-2016
----------------------------

This is yet another emulator front end.  I wrote this because just about
every emulator front-end I looked at was either system specific, or ran as a
gui window.

I was looking for something that could run in full screen kiosk mode,
and run emulators full screen, was independant of any gui or windowing
system.  I also wanted a system that could support virtually
any emulator.

So I wrote EMUFE.  Current Features are
* Run in kiosk mode, but can run in a window.
* Themable
* Extensible, can be made to work with most emulators
* uses SDL (or Allegro)
* Runs on Linux and Windows
* Supports descriptions and artwork
* Designed so that it can be run off a CD, DVD or USB drive, either as
  boot device with it's own OS, or run with a currently running OS
* Designed to be read only (for CD use), but makes local storage of
  save disks, nvram, etc for save games and other permenant changes

Future Plans
* Port to arm devices (Raspberry Pi, maybe Android devices too)
* Pull graphics and descriptions from the web rather than store them
  local
* Port to SDL2
* Make a decent looking HD theme.
* Better configuration

Emufe doesn't work it's magic alone, there is a set of scripts that run it,
and translate generic wishes (enable fullscreen, use joysticks) into
emulator specific settings.  To get those scripts, as well as a sample
setup, you will need to download the emufe-env-1.0.tar.gz package.

This package contains two binaries:
  emufe, the actual menu system
  splsh, a splash screen that I launch when my emulator CD is insterted.
Completely optional.

Requirements:
  Allegro (alleg.sf.net)
  emufe-env-1.0.tar.gz (unless you want to develop your own set of scripts)
